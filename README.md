This is a simple bash script to allow for the easy hooking of Windows games running via Steam Proton with [Textractor](https://github.com/Artikash/Textractor) on Linux. You'll need to edit the path for the location of your textractor, under the variable `textractor`, and depending on how you've installed your games the location of the compat data path. But once that's done, just run the script with `./textractor_steam.sh %id` after launching the game, where id is the Steam appid of the game, or a custom name you've supplied as an override. Two free visual novels ([Narcissu 1st & 2nd](https://store.steampowered.com/app/264380/Narcissu_1st__2nd/) and [Higurashi When They Cry Hou - Ch.1 Onikakushi](https://store.steampowered.com/app/310360/Higurashi_When_They_Cry_Hou__Ch1_Onikakushi/)) have custom overrides included in the script as a way to demostrate the format.
