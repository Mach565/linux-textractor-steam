This is a simple bash script to allow for the easy hooking of Windows games running via Steam Proton with [Textractor](https://github.com/Artikash/Textractor) on Linux. You **will** need to edit the path for the location of your textractor, under the variable `textractor`, and depending on how you've installed your games the location of the compat data path. But once that's done, just run the script with `./textractor_steam.sh %id %delay`, where `%id` is the Steam appid of the game, or a custom name you've supplied as an override, and `%delay` is how long the script waits before starting Textractor after launching the game (can be blank, in which case the default is 20 seconds). The script automatically launches the game, but if you've already started the game manually don't worry about it.

Two free visual novels ([Narcissu 1st & 2nd](https://store.steampowered.com/app/264380/Narcissu_1st__2nd/) and [Higurashi When They Cry Hou - Ch.1 Onikakushi](https://store.steampowered.com/app/310360/Higurashi_When_They_Cry_Hou__Ch1_Onikakushi/)) have custom overrides included in the script as a way to demostrate the format.
